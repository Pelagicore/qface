Reference Generators
====================

QFace does provide some real world reference generators which are hosted as separated projects. Their purpose is merely to showcase how to write a code generator using QFace. They are working and complete examples of general purpose generators.

`qface-qtcpp`_

    The QtCPP generator generates a Qt C++ plugin with a QML API ready to be used in your project.

`qface-qtqml`_

    The QtQml generator generates a QML only API which ready to be used.

`qface-qtro`_

    The RO (RemoteObjects) generator generates a client and server project using the Qt5 QtRemoteObejcts library

From the QML user interface perspective the QtCPP and QtQML generators both provide the same API and are interchangeable.
